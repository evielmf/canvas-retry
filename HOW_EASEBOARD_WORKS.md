# 📊 How Easeboard Canvas LMS Works - Complete User Flow Analysis

## 🔐 **Authentication & Initial Access**

**When users first visit Easeboard:**

1. **Landing Page**: Users arrive at the main page (`/`) which displays a beautiful, calming landing page with a matte black design
2. **Authentication Check**: The system automatically checks if they're logged in via Supabase
3. **Google OAuth**: If not authenticated, users see a "Get Started with Google" button
4. **OAuth Flow**: Clicking this initiates Google OAuth through Supabase Auth with redirect to `/auth/callback`
5. **Session Creation**: After successful Google authentication, users are redirected to `/dashboard`

### Technical Flow:
```typescript
Landing Page → Auth Check → Google OAuth → Supabase Auth → Session → Dashboard
```
